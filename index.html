<center><font size = "+2">This is my favorite reddit thread from the bot usage because I think that Bernie and Andrew Yang have very similar bases save that</font></center>

<center><font size = "+2">Bernie's economic plans are less finance supported like Andrew Yang's is. I also like it because I think these are the two biggest support factions of the Democratic Party candidates.</font></center>
<p><center>This is a link to my favorite <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/csci040/comments/dw53wt/political_discussion_thread/f9ijm2l?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x">thread</p></center></a>
  <p><center>I think I deserve a 105/100 because I have complete the following extra credit tasks</p></center>
  <ul>
    <center><li> Have your bot upvote any comment mentioning your favorite political candidate.</li></center>
    <center><li> Make your bot reply to highly upvoted comments before replying to lower upvoted comments. </li></center>
    <center><li> If your bot writes more than 200 comments, you get this extra credit</li></center>
  </ul>
